# splunk built in anomlay detection
splunk has built in anomlay detection, this saves me a whole bunch of effort and paragraphs of SPL
[SearchReference/Anomalydetection](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/6.5.1/SearchReference/Anomalydetection "SearchReference/Anomalydetection")

Example 1: Return only anomalous events
These two searches return the same results. The arguments specified in the second search are the default values.

... | anomalydetection

... | anomalydetection method=histogram action=filter

Example 2: Return a short summary of how many anomalous events are there
Return a short summary of how many anomalous events are there and some other statistics such as the threshold value used to detect them.

... | anomalydetection action=summary

Example 3: Return events with anomalous values
... | anomalydetection method=zscore action=filter pthresh=0.05

Example 4: Return outliers
... | anomalydetection method=iqr action=tf param=4 uselower=true mark=true

The abbreviation tf is used for the transform action in this example.

Before when you wanted to use zscorign youd have to do someething like this
```eventstats stdev(requestcount) as std by _time |
eventstats avg(requestcount) as "requestaverage" by _time |
eval threexstd=round(3*std) |
eval threshold=round(threexstd + requestaverage) |
where requestcount > threshold |```
