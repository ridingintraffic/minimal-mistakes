# docker powershell
To prove a point i went out and foudn that there is a microsoft supported docker image for powershell.
https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/powershell/
this means that running a mac, you can run docker that runs linux and then will let you run powershell..   You must go deeper...  ha
